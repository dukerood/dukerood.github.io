    "text": "It is clear that football is the biggest game that is played in every type of weather. From smoking hot to freezing cold, football has it all. I think this is what makes football great and unique. However, some may say these different conditions ruin the game.\nSo how does these different weather conditions, effect the game we know and love.\nFirst, lets take a look at how home field advantage comes to play. Does the home team score more then the away team, in different weather conditions?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nscores &lt;- read_csv(\"scores_2024.csv\")\ngames &lt;- read_csv(\"games_2024.csv\")\nweather &lt;- read_csv(\"weather_2024.csv\")\n\ngame_weather &lt;- games |&gt; inner_join(weather) \nscores_weather &lt;- scores |&gt; inner_join(weather)\n\n\nLooking at the away team first.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=away_points)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=away_points), method=\"lm\")+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Temperature\", \n    y=\"Away Team Points\", \n    title=\"Did the Away team score a lot in different climates\", \n    subtitle=\"Comapring this to Home teams average scoring in different climates\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBFastR | Duke Rood\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Now the home team\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=home_points)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=home_points), method=\"lm\")+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Temperature\", \n    y=\"Home Team Points\", \n    title=\"Did the Home team score a lot in different climates\", \n    subtitle=\"Comapring this to Home teams average scoring in different climates\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBFastR | Duke Rood\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, from the looks of it, the home team has the advantage. But lets see what the numbers say. Again, starting with the away team.\n\n\nCode\nfit &lt;- lm(away_points ~ temperature, data = scores_weather)\nsummary(fit)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = away_points ~ temperature, data = scores_weather)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-24.451 -10.108  -2.084   9.802  60.668 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) 27.81273    1.45895  19.064   &lt;2e-16 ***\ntemperature  0.02019    0.02048   0.986    0.324    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 15.81 on 3173 degrees of freedom\n  (1 observation deleted due to missingness)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.0003061, Adjusted R-squared:  -8.965e-06 \nF-statistic: 0.9715 on 1 and 3173 DF,  p-value: 0.3244\n\n\nThe numbers confirm the question that the home team has the advantage in any weather condition. This is something that we probably already knew.\nHow does weather really effect the game? College football has undergone a huge change with Quarterbacks dominating weekly. However, do they still dominate when there is rain present?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_line(data = game_weather, aes(x=off_passing_downs_success_rate, y=precipitation)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Passing Success Rate\", \n    y=\"Precipitation\", \n    title=\"Is Passing successful in Rainy conditions\", \n    subtitle=\"Seeing if the rain damages the Passing Parade\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBFastR | Duke Rood\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the success rate of passing and precipitation in the games. It would appear the rain does not have too much of an effect on passing.\nSo we know that precipitation doesn’t effect the passing game as much, but does it effect the rest of the offense being explosive? Explosive plays are where teams can die or come back from a game. Is it hard to get an explosive play when there is rain. Will it rain on the offensive’s parade?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=game_weather, \n    aes(x=precipitation, y=off_explosiveness, size=off_explosiveness),\n    alpha = 0.3) + \n  scale_size(range = c(0, 15), name=\"Explosiveness\")+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Precipitation\", \n    y=\"Offensive Explosiveness\", \n    title=\"Does the rain slow down big, explosive plays?\", \n    subtitle=\"Are games less explosive in the rain?\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBFastR | Duke Rood\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows a big patch on the left, where there was no precipitation during the game. As it spreads to the right, the more precipitation there is. The more rain there is, the less explosive the offenses got. None got over the 2 threshold. I think it is safe to say that rain does effect the game.\nSource for all the graphs: CFBFastR"

    "text": "Code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\n\npassing &lt;- read_csv(\"Passing Stats top 10 - Sheet1.csv\")\npassing2 &lt;- read_csv(\"Copy of Passing Stats top 10 - Sheet1.csv\")\n\n\nThe 2025 NFL season has been as close of a season that we have ever seen. The playoff race for the AFC and NFC is super close with lots of deserving teams that may miss the cut. As well as the MVP race, which has been a neck and neck race with two players separating themselves from the rest. The first is second year Quarterback Drake Maye of the New England Patriots. Maye, 23, is leading the Patriots back to their old ways with the help of first year Head Coach Mike Vrabel. The second, and my personal pick, is the 37 year old, Matthew Stafford of the LA Rams.\nStafford has led the Rams to the best record in the NFC, and hasn’t showed any signs of regression in his 17th season in the league. In fact, he is on pace for the best season of his career.\nSo lets get into the numbers on why Matthew Stafford should win MVP. Lets start with the fact that he leads the league in passing touchdowns.\n\n\nCode\nstafford &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Matthew Stafford\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=passing, aes(x=reorder(Player, TD), weight=TD)) +\n  geom_bar(data=stafford, aes(x=reorder(Player, TD), weight=TD), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"Passing Touchdowns\", \n    title=\"NFL Passing Touchdowns Top 10\", \n    subtitle=\"As of Week 15\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | Duke Rood\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStafford has thrown 35 touchdowns thus far. That number is the most in the league by 9! Jared Goff and Dak Prescott are tied for second with 26. Not only is Stafford scoring the most in the league by far, he is tied for the least amount of interceptions thrown, among qualified passers.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=passing, \n    aes(y=Player, x=TD, xend=Int),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Interceptions are in Red and Touchdowns are in Green\", \n    y=\"Player\", \n    title=\"Passing Touchdowns to Interception ratio\", \n    subtitle=\"As of Week 15\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | Duke Rood\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Interceptions are in red, and Touchdowns are in green. There is a huge gap between his league lead in Touchdowns compared to his only 3 picks on the year. Stafford has the Rams scoring a lot of points, while not turning it over. In fact he broke an NFL record last week for most TDs thrown without an interception, at 28. Ironically taking a Patriot’s record as Tom Brady previously held that record.\nLastly, lets look at Passer Rating and Passing Success Rating. Passer Rating evaluates passing performance, indicating effectiveness in leading the offense through the air. Passing Success Rating measures a passer’s performance and efficiency in the passing game. So, lets take a look at the numbers.\n\n\nCode\npassing2 |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Rate = \"Passer Rating\",\n    `Succ%` = \"Passing Success Rating\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Comparing Passer Rating and Passing Success Rating among Top 10 QBs\",\n    subtitle = \"As of Week 15\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Duke Rood  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Matthew Stafford\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing Passer Rating and Passing Success Rating among Top 10 QBs\n\n\nAs of Week 15\n\n\nPlayer\nPassing Success Rating\nPasser Rating\n\n\n\n\nDak Prescott\n49.0\n100.2\n\n\nDrake Maye\n52.6\n111.9\n\n\nPatrick Mahomes\n47.9\n91.2\n\n\nMatthew Stafford\n55.0\n113.1\n\n\nJared Goff\n50.3\n110.2\n\n\nSam Darnold\n51.8\n103.8\n\n\nDaniel Jones\n52.0\n100.2\n\n\nJosh Allen\n49.9\n102.9\n\n\nJordan Love\n51.0\n105.4\n\n\nBo Nix\n45.3\n86.4\n\n\n\nBy: Duke Rood | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Stafford is the most efficient and effective passer in the league this year. His ability to protect the ball, while scoring at a high level at the most effective rate in the league makes it clear that he deserves MVP. I like to judge an MVP on if they take him off of the team, will they still perform at a high level. It appears that if you took Stafford off the Rams, the Rams lose a lot of their touchdowns, and the offense wouldn’t be performing nearly as well as they are this season. This is in large part thanks to Matthew Stafford’s historic MVP campaign."
