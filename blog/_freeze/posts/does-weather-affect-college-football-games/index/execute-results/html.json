From smoking hot to freezing cold, football has it all.\n\nHow does these different weather conditions, effect the game we know and love.\n\nFirst, lets take a look at how home field advantage comes to play. Does the home team score more then the away team, in different weather conditions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nscores <- read_csv(\"scores_2024.csv\")\ngames <- read_csv(\"games_2024.csv\")\nweather <- read_csv(\"weather_2024.csv\")\n\ngame_weather <- games |> inner_join(weather) \nscores_weather <- scores |> inner_join(weather)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the away team first. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=away_points)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=away_points), method=\"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nAnd Now the home team\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=home_points)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=scores_weather, aes(x=temperature, y=home_points), method=\"lm\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, from the looks of it, the home team has the advantage. But lets see what the numbers say. Again, starting with the away team. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit <- lm(away_points ~ temperature, data = scores_weather)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = away_points ~ temperature, data = scores_weather)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-24.451 -10.108  -2.084   9.802  60.668 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This is something that we probably already knew. \n\nHow does weather really effect the game? College football has undergone a huge change with Quarterbacks dominating weekly. However, do they still dominate when there is rain present?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + geom_line(data = game_weather, aes(x=off_passing_downs_success_rate, y=precipitation)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis graph shows the success rate of passing and precipitation in the games. It would appear the rain does not have too much of an effect on passing. \n\nSo we know that precipitation doesn't effect the passing game as much, but does it effect the rest of the offense being explosive? Explosive plays are where teams can die or come back from a game. Is it hard to get an explosive play when there is rain. Will it rain on the offensive's parade? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=game_weather, \n    aes(x=precipitation, y=off_explosiveness, size=off_explosiveness),\n    alpha = 0.3) + \n  scale_size(range = c(0, 15), name=\"Explosiveness\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
